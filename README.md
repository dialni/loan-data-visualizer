# Loan Data Visualizer (for Reddit)
On online forums and social media, such as Facebook or Reddit, there exists communities that facillitate private loans online. These loans might be in the range of $5 to several thousands of dollars, and are done outside any traditional institutions, such as banks or credit unions. This project aims to look at and analyze these online loans, and answer 4 fundamental questions:
- How saturated is this marked? (Loans given vs loans requested)
- What is the on average volume of money transfered?
- How many actually pay back their loans?
- Is this actually a profitable venture?

In particular, this project aims to look at the r/borrow subreddit, which at the time of writing has over 23k weekly visitors.

# I don't have access to Reddit Data API!
Due to the [Reddit Data API rules](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/16160319875092-Reddit-Data-API-Wiki), it is not possible to have this data hosted on GitHub directly. Instead, an online tool will be available soon<sup>tm</sup> and a link will be posted here.
